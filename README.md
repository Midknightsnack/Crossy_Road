# Crossy Road Project
Here's some gameplay of my Crossy Road. The game isn't endless and I only created a small amount of level.

<br>The Lane Spawner does exist but I chose not to include it because it makes the game look cluttered and it's unfinished.

<br>Collisions with the environment work but only when the chicken is the root component. However, placing the chicken as the root component messed up the chicken's movement, camera, and rotation. I couldn't figure out how to fix the issue so I made another playable chicken that is able to collide with the environment but not the cars.
